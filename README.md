This is a project that I made for my video game design class. It is a playable elite four challenge based on Pokémon Fire Red.
The game can be started by navigating into the second pokered folder and running 'python3 main.py' in the terminal.
The player is controlled by using wasd and the player interacts with objects by pressing enter. When applicable, the player can press 'b' to go back (when in a menu screen). There are certain aspects of the battle system, like weather for example, that are still not fully implemented. Moreover, not all of the moves have animations. 

Requires:
   - Pygame
   - Pandas

Controls:
   - Movement: WASD
   - Select: Enter key
   - Back: B
   - Menu: Shift key

Current known bugs:
   - Need to add a change of direction timer to player to make them stop for a couple ticks when changing direction. 
   - The PC is currently a work in progress and will likely crash if you mess around with it.
