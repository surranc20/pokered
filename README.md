This is a project that I made for my video game design class. It is a playable elite four challenge based on Pok√©mon Fire Red. 
The game can be started by navigating into the second pokered folder and running 'python3 main.py' in the terminal. 
The player is controlled by using wasd and the player interacts with objects by pressing enter. When applicable, the player can press 'b' to go back (when in a menu screen). There are certain aspects of the battle system, like weather for example, that are still not fully implemented. Moreover, not all of the moves have animations. It is possible that I will continue development on this project in the future.

Current known bugs:
   - Trainers can be talked to after battles and it will start another battle with them. All of the opposing trainer's pokemon will have fainted and the battle will end in one turn.
